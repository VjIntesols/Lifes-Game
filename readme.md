## Source

This app source is open for anyone as an educational resource for learning. If you have any feature requests or found bugs in the app, please email me through supp.tapstudios@gmail.com

## Development Process

This app was built over the course of a year through the use of Android Studio. All the designs/assets used within this app were made by me using Adobe Illustrator.
The app makes use of an SQLite database as a means of storing the user's data within their phone. This was done to ensure that the user has
full control over their data. Google Analytics is used as a tool to help monitor app performance and for determining new features/bug fixes to implement within the app.
For notifications and app invites, Google Firebase is used.
